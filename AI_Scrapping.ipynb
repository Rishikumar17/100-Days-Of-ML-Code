       "[<p>Prior to Java 2, Java provided ad hoc classes such as <b>Dictionary, Vector, Stack,</b> and <b>Properties</b> to store and manipulate groups of objects. Although these classes were quite useful, they lacked a central, unifying theme. Thus, the way that you used Vector was different from the way that you used Properties.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The collections framework was designed to meet several goals, such as âˆ’</p>,\n",
       " <p>The framework had to be high-performance. The implementations for the fundamental collections (dynamic arrays, linked lists, trees, and hashtables) were to be highly efficient.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The framework had to allow different types of collections to work in a similar manner and with a high degree of interoperability.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The framework had to extend and/or adapt a collection easily.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Towards this end, the entire collections framework is designed around a set of standard interfaces. Several standard implementations such as <b>LinkedList, HashSet,</b> and <b>TreeSet</b>, of these interfaces are provided that you may use as-is and you may also implement your own collection, if you choose.</p>,\n",
       " <p>A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. All collections frameworks contain the following âˆ’</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>Interfaces</b> âˆ’ These are abstract data types that represent collections. Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. In object-oriented languages, interfaces generally form a hierarchy.</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>Implementations, i.e., Classes</b> âˆ’ These are the concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are reusable data structures.</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>Algorithms</b> âˆ’ These are the methods that perform useful computations, such as searching and sorting, on objects that implement collection interfaces. The algorithms are said to be polymorphic: that is, the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface.</p>,\n",
       " <p>In addition to collections, the framework defines several map interfaces and classes. Maps store key/value pairs. Although maps are not <i>collections</i> in the proper use of the term, but they are fully integrated with collections.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The collections framework defines several interfaces. This section provides an overview of each interface âˆ’</p>,\n",
       " <p>This enables you to work with groups of objects; it is at the top of the collections hierarchy.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This extends <b>Collection</b> and an instance of List stores an ordered collection of elements.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This extends Collection to handle sets, which must contain unique elements.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This extends Set to handle sorted sets.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This maps unique keys to values.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This describes an element (a key/value pair) in a map. This is an inner class of Map.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This extends Map so that the keys are maintained in an ascending order.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This is legacy interface defines the methods by which you can enumerate (obtain one at a time) the elements in a collection of objects. This legacy interface has been superceded by Iterator.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Java provides a set of standard collection classes that implement Collection interfaces. Some of the classes provide full implementations that can be used as-is and others are abstract class, providing skeletal implementations that are used as starting points for creating concrete collections.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The standard collection classes are summarized in the following table âˆ’</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>AbstractCollection</b></p>,\n",
       " <p>Implements most of the Collection interface.</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>AbstractList</b></p>,\n",
       " <p>Extends AbstractCollection and implements most of the List interface.</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>AbstractSequentialList</b></p>,\n",
       " <p>Extends AbstractList for use by a collection that uses sequential rather than random access of its elements.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Implements a linked list by extending AbstractSequentialList.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Implements a dynamic array by extending AbstractList.</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>AbstractSet</b></p>,\n",
       " <p>Extends AbstractCollection and implements most of the Set interface.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Extends AbstractSet for use with a hash table.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Extends HashSet to allow insertion-order iterations.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Implements a set stored in a tree. Extends AbstractSet.</p>,\n",
       " <p><b>AbstractMap</b></p>,\n",
       " <p>Implements most of the Map interface.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Extends AbstractMap to use a hash table.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Extends AbstractMap to use a tree.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Extends AbstractMap to use a hash table with weak keys.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Extends HashMap to allow insertion-order iterations.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Extends AbstractMap and uses reference equality when comparing documents.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The <i>AbstractCollection, AbstractSet, AbstractList, AbstractSequentialList</i> and <i>AbstractMap</i> classes provide skeletal implementations of the core collection interfaces, to minimize the effort required to implement them.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The following legacy classes defined by java.util have been discussed in the previous chapter âˆ’</p>,\n",
       " <p>This implements a dynamic array. It is similar to ArrayList, but with some differences.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Stack is a subclass of Vector that implements a standard last-in, first-out stack.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Dictionary is an abstract class that represents a key/value storage repository and operates much like Map.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Hashtable was part of the original java.util and is a concrete implementation of a Dictionary.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Properties is a subclass of Hashtable. It is used to maintain lists of values in which the key is a String and the value is also a String.</p>,\n",
       " <p>A BitSet class creates a special type of array that holds bit values. This array can increase in size as needed.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The collections framework defines several algorithms that can be applied to collections and maps. These algorithms are defined as static methods within the Collections class.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Several of the methods can throw a <b>ClassCastException</b>, which occurs when an attempt is made to compare incompatible types, or an <b>UnsupportedOperationException</b>, which occurs when an attempt is made to modify an unmodifiable collection.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Collections define three static variables: EMPTY_SET, EMPTY_LIST, and EMPTY_MAP. All are immutable.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Here is a list of all the algorithm implementation.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Often, you will want to cycle through the elements in a collection. For example, you might want to display each element.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The easiest way to do this is to employ an iterator, which is an object that implements either the Iterator or the ListIterator interface.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Iterator enables you to cycle through a collection, obtaining or removing elements. ListIterator extends Iterator to allow bidirectional traversal of a list and the modification of elements.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Here is a list of all the methods with examples provided by Iterator  and ListIterator interfaces.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Both TreeSet and TreeMap store elements in a sorted order. However, it is the comparator that defines precisely what <i>sorted order</i> means.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This interface lets us sort a given collection any number of different ways. Also this interface can be used to sort any instances of any class (even classes we cannot modify).</p>,\n",
       " <p>Here is a list of all the methods with examples provided by Comparator Interface.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The Java collections framework gives the programmer access to prepackaged data structures as well as to algorithms for manipulating them.</p>,\n",
       " <p>A collection is an object that can hold references to other objects. The collection interfaces declare the operations that can be performed on each type of collection.</p>,\n",
